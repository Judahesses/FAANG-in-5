# FAANG-in-5:
#### Predicting if you will make a profit investing in Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google over the next 5 years

Used API and requests to get stock data from https://www.worldtradingdata.com
<br />
Created an algorithm to get data based on a given stock
<br />
Combined Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Googles stocks and made a 5 year projection on whether or not you will make a profit 
investing in all 5 stocks. 
<br />
Used Facebook Profit to see how their model runs and to see how it differs from the SARIMAX model

#### How to view stock projections of your own choosing:
  1. download all files from this GitHub Repo
  2. open stock_projections_presentation.ipynb
  3. run file with desired stock symbol
